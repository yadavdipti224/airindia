                            <h3>Our Privacy Policies</h3>  

                            <h6>Note:</h6>
                            <p>1. This Privacy Policy pertains only to the AISATS website and AISATS's practices. Words and expressions defined in the AISATS website Terms and Conditions of Use apply equally to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all Users who access the AISATS website and/or use of Services.</p>

                            <p>2. By accessing and/or using the AISATS website and/or Services, you consent to the collection and use by AISATS of certain personal information from or about you, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                            <p>3. As we cannot distinguish the age of persons who access the AISATS website, a blanket Privacy Policy is applied. If a child has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should email us to remove the information and unsubscribe him. AISATS does not intend to receive information from minors.</p> 
                            
                            <p>4. We collect or may collect the following types of information from you: a. general statistical information about Users for general reporting and to improve future content. Such information may include service provider, browser type, pages accessed on the Site, what site you came from or go to, and which pages you go to within the Site; b. personal information about you to provide you with a range of personalized services, depending on how you use the AISATS website; c. records of any email or other correspondence that you send via the Site; d. your IP address, name, mailing address and email address, and cookie information.</p>

                            <p>5. Generally, you can visit most parts of the AISATS website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself; however, some Services may not be accessible unless personal information is supplied.</p>

                            <p>6. AISATS may use and disclose the information collected from you through the Site: a. for the purpose(s) for which the personal information was requested, and related purposes; b. for AISATS’ requirements and purposes such as research, audit and analysis and to help us improve our goods and services, content and advertising; c. to respond to your queries and requests and to communicate with you; d. to send you information, updates, promotions, and marketing and advertising materials in relation to AISATS and its goods, products and/or services (including without limitation, customizing the content for you, and to contact you on updates), or those of any individual, firm, corporation, organization or entity having an agreement or understanding with AISATS with respect to the cross-selling or cross- promotion of goods and/or services; e. to comply with applicable law, regulation, the requests of governmental and regulatory authorities, or orders of court; f. to enforce contractual and legal rights and obligations and/or to prosecute or defend legal actions or other proceedings; g. for Internal record keeping; and/or h. for any other purpose for which we have obtained your consent.</p>

                            <p>7. When AISATS appoints service providers to perform any services on its behalf, we will use reasonable endeavors to ensure that such service providers abide by this Privacy Policy.</p>

                            <p>8. We do not sell your name or other personal information relating to you to third parties.</p>

                            <p>9. If you would like to unsubscribe from receiving our mailings or do not want us to share your email address with other parties, please inform us using one of the communication channels in the Contact Us webpage.</p>

                            <p>10. AISATS will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information you share with us. On your part, if you become aware of any security breach, please let us know as soon as possible.</p>

                            <p>11. Please do not share any User identification, password, personal identification number or other authentication information, if any, used by you on the AISATS website, with anyone. AISATS will not be responsible or held liable for lapses in security caused by unauthorized third party access arising directly or indirectly out of your failure to keep such information confidential.</p>
                            
                            <p>12. A cookie is a small string of information that a website transfers to your browser for identification purposes. The cookies we pass to your computer are anonymous and do not hold information about you or reveal your personal identity.

Please note that rejecting cookies may limit the functionality of the Site. Our advertisers may also set cookies separately in your computer.</p>

                            <p>13. The AISATS website may contain links to third party websites whose data protection and privacy policies may differ from ours. We are not responsible for the content and privacy practices of these other websites and you should check and consult the privacy policies/notices of those websites before accessing them and/or providing any personal information to them.</p>

                            <p>14. We have the right to amend, revise or change this Privacy Policy (or part thereof) from time to time without any prior notice or subsequent notice to you. By accessing the AISATS website and/or using the Services, you agree to be legally bound by any such amended, revised and/or changed Privacy Policy.
